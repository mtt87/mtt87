### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I consider myself mostly a product engineer. I've been building various products and tools over the years both while working at
different companies and in my spare time, and that's what I enjoy the most. 

I work mainly with React, React Native, node.js,
GraphQL and have been using Typescript since last year.
