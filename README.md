### Hello ðŸ‘‹,
I'm **Mattia**, a self-taught **software engineer** with 13+ years of experience.

I've been building **products** and tools over the years while working at different companies but I very much enjoy doing it in my spare time as well. I work best with **Javascript/Typescript** across the **full stack** but I specialise on the frontend where I've been using **React** for many years.
I started learning **Rust** in 2024 and while I've built a couple of services, I consider myself a beginner.

I'm always trying to find new ways to use **Raspberry Pis** currently exploring **home automation, LoRa mesh networks** and building a little cluster as home lab.

I'm a videogamer, mostly switching between **World of Warcraft** and **League of Legends** but occasionally enjoying single player cozy games on my PlayStation 5.

My CV is available in [PDF](https://mtt.engineer/mattia_asti.pdf), [HTML](https://mtt.engineer/cv) or [JSON](https://mtt.engineer/cv.json).
