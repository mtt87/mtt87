### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I consider myself mostly a product engineer. I've been building various products and tools over the years both while working at different companies and in my spare time, and that's what I enjoy the most. 

I work best with Javascript/Typescript using React, React Native, Node.js, GraphQL and CSS-in-JS.
